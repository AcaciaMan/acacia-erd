# Change Log

All notable changes to the "acacia-erd" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Open Diagram shows saved entities** — Clicking an ERD diagram in the Assets tree now correctly renders the saved entities in the ERD Editor, even when the panel is freshly created. Previously the diagram could open with an empty canvas because entity data was not passed to the webview.

### Improved
- **InteractiveERDPanel.openDiagram()** — Now sends the full entities array alongside diagram metadata in the `loadDiagram` message, so the webview always has entity data available
- **loadDiagramIntoCanvas()** — Accepts optional `providedEntities` parameter, falling back to DOM entities only when none are supplied

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **ERD Diagram Management** — Named diagrams are now first-class objects in the Assets tree, nested under their parent Entities List with full lifecycle management
- **DiagramManager** utility — New `DiagramManager` class for CRUD operations on diagram configurations, file-based persistence (`*.diagrams.json`), and `FileSystemWatcher` for external changes
- **DiagramItem** tree node — New `DiagramItem` in the Assets tree showing diagram name, entity count badge, and double-click to open
- **Add/Open/Rename/Delete/Duplicate Diagram** commands — Five new commands registered in `package.json` with context menus on Entities List and Diagram tree items
- **Diagram data model** — `DiagramConfig` type storing `id`, `name`, `entityIds`, and entity `positions` (x/y coordinates)
- **Save Diagram** — Persists the current canvas state (entity selection and positions) back to the diagram JSON file, plus an SVG snapshot alongside
- **Save As Diagram** — Creates a new named diagram from the current ERD canvas, with auto-detection of the parent entities list and auto-generated `diagramsPath`
- **Open Diagram** — Loads a saved diagram into the Interactive ERD Editor: filters entities, applies saved positions, updates panel title
- **Entity Sync Detection** — `EntitySyncChecker` utility compares a diagram's entity references against the current entities list and warns about missing entities on open
- **Auto-Repair** — "Remove Missing & Open" option in the sync warning dialog strips stale entity references and saves the cleaned diagram
- **Webview diagram toolbar** — "Save Diagram" and "Save As Diagram" buttons in the Interactive ERD toolbar, diagram name display in the status bar
- **Webview diagram functions** — `collectDiagramState()` reads entity IDs, positions, and SVG from the canvas; `loadDiagramIntoCanvas()` filters and positions entities; `updateDiagramStatusBar()` shows the loaded diagram name
- **`diagramsPath` on EntitiesListConfig** — Optional field linking an entities list to its diagrams JSON file, with `setDiagramsPath()` method and schema update
- **DiagramManager test suite** — Comprehensive tests for diagram CRUD, file persistence, and watcher events
- **EntitySyncChecker test suite** — Tests for sync detection, message formatting, truncation, and `repairDiagram()` pure function
- **EntitiesListManager `diagramsPath` tests** — Tests for `setDiagramsPath()` added to existing test suite

### Improved
- **AssetsTreeProvider** — Entities list items are now collapsible when `diagramsPath` is configured; `getChildren()` returns `DiagramItem` children; `DiagramManager` cache with `getDiagramManagerForList()` accessor
- **InteractiveERDPanel** — Tracks `_currentDiagram`, `_currentListName`, and `_currentDiagramManager` state; new `openDiagram()` static method with entity sync check; `handleSaveDiagram()` and `handleSaveAsDiagram()` handlers; proper cleanup on dispose
- **extension.ts** — Six new command handlers for diagram CRUD with auto-generated `diagramsPath` and `QuickPick` fallbacks when invoked from the Command Palette

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Dimension Manager** — New `DimensionManager` utility for defining, persisting, and managing custom dimensions (e.g., Level, Environment, Schema) with seed defaults and file-based storage (`acacia-erd.dimensions.json`)
- **Dimension Editor Panel** — Dedicated webview panel for creating, editing, and deleting dimensions and their values, with asset assignment matrix
- **Assign Dimensions context menu** — Right-click any Source Folder, DB Connection, or Entities List in the Assets tree to assign dimension values
- **Filter Assets by Dimensions** — Quick Pick multi-step filter: select a dimension, then pick values to show only matching assets in the tree
- **Filter badge & clear** — Active filter count badge on the Assets tree view; "Clear Asset Filters" button appears when filters are active
- **Inline dimension badges** — Assets tree items display dimension value badges for at-a-glance categorization
- **Interactive ERD dimension display** — Dimension assignments surfaced in the Interactive ERD Editor
- **Dimension configuration setting** — New `acacia-erd.dimensionsFilePath` setting to customize the dimensions file location
- **Dimension properties on asset configs** — `dimensions` object added to Source Folder, DB Connection, and Entities List configuration schemas
- **DimensionManager test suite** — Comprehensive tests for dimension CRUD, file persistence, and event handling
- **AssetsTreeProvider dimension tests** — Extended test suite covering dimension badges, filtering, and assignment

### Improved
- **AssetsTreeProvider** — Refactored to support dimension filtering, badge rendering, and `DimensionManager` integration
- **ERDViewProvider** — Now accepts `DimensionManager` for dimension-aware dashboard status
- **InteractiveERDPanel** — Enhanced to receive `DimensionManager` and `EntitiesListManager` for richer context

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Create New Entities List from UI** — The "Choose Entities List" dialog now offers both "Open Existing" and "Create New" options, allowing users to create a new empty entities JSON file directly from the Interactive ERD Editor
- **Save dialog for new entities lists** — Uses the native VS Code save dialog with a default filename and JSON filter, pre-populated with the workspace root

### Improved
- **Async entities list selection** — The `chooseEntitiesList` flow is now fully async/await for more reliable dialog handling
- **Refactored path application** — Extracted `applyEntitiesListPath` helper to reduce code duplication when setting the entities JSON path

## [2.2.3] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Unified Assets Tree** — Single sidebar tree combining Source Folders, DB Connections, and Entities Lists with collapsible sections
- **Entities Lists management** — Add, remove, rename, and edit paths for multiple entities JSON files, persisted to workspace configuration (`acacia-erd.entitiesLists`)
- **Active entities list indicator** — Check icon (✓) and "active" badge on the currently loaded entities list in the Assets tree
- **Select entities list** — Click an entities list in Assets to switch the active entities file across all views
- **Entity Tree file indicator** — Shows which entities JSON file is currently loaded in the Entity Tree header
- **Entity Tree enhanced empty state** — Contextual messaging for filter-no-match vs no-entities-loaded, with "Browse Assets" action button
- **InteractiveERD path sync** — Path display in Interactive ERD Editor auto-updates when switching entities lists
- **Dashboard integration** — Quick Actions grid with "View Entities" and "View Assets" buttons; Project Status shows live counts for entities, entities lists, source folders, and DB connections
- **SourceFolderManager** utility — CRUD operations for source folders persisted to workspace configuration (`acacia-erd.sourceFolders`)
- **DbConnectionManager** utility — CRUD operations for DB connections persisted to workspace configuration (`acacia-erd.dbConnections`)
- **EntitiesListManager** utility — CRUD operations for entities lists persisted to workspace configuration (`acacia-erd.entitiesLists`)
- **EntityManager file watcher** — Auto-reloads entities on external create/change/delete events with debounced reload (300ms)
- **EntityManager event emitters** — `onDidChangeEntities` and `onDidChangeEntitiesPath` events for reactive updates
- **EntityManager configuration listener** — Watches `acacia-erd.entitiesJsonPath` setting changes and re-initializes
- **AssetsTreeProvider** — Native tree data provider with inline context menu actions (rename, edit path, remove)
- **Comprehensive test suites** — Tests for AssetsTreeProvider, EntitiesListManager, EntityTreePanel, ERDViewProvider, InteractiveERDPanel, and all extension commands

### Improved
- **Sidebar organization** — Consolidated three separate views into a single Assets tree for cleaner UX
- **EntityManager path resolution** — Resolves relative paths from workspace root; stores workspace-relative paths in settings
- **EntityManager disposal** — Properly disposes file watcher, config listener, event emitters, and debounce timeout
- **ERDViewProvider** — Dashboard auto-updates status on entity/path/list/folder/connection changes

### Removed
