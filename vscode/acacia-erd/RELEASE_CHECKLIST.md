## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

   - Fix the issue
   - Bump to v2.2.1
   - Republish

2. **No Quick Fix** (> 2 hours)
   - Unpublish v2.2.0 from marketplace
   - Revert to v2.1.0

   - Fix and release v2.2.1 later

## Success Metrics (Track over 30 days)

- [ ] Installation count increase
- [ ] User ratings/reviews
- [ ] GitHub stars increase
- [ ] Issues opened (bugs vs features)
- [ ] Community feedback sentiment

**Target Goals:**
- 50+ new installs in first week
- Reach 500 total installs (from current 407)
- Maintain 4+ star rating
- Get at least 2-3 positive reviews mentioning HTML export

## Known Limitations to Document

If users report these, they're expected:
- HTML files are larger than SVG (by design - includes all features)
- Exported HTML is read-only (not an editor)
- Very large ERDs (100+ entities) may be slow on old devices
- Requires modern browser (2020+)

## Support Preparation

Have ready answers for:

**Q: "How do I export to HTML?"**
A: Open your ERD, click the green "Export HTML" button in the toolbar, choose save location. [Link to docs]

**Q: "The HTML file won't open"**
A: Right-click the file â†’ Open With â†’ Your Browser. The file needs to open in a web browser, not a text editor.

**Q: "Can I edit the exported HTML?"**
A: The HTML export is for viewing and sharing only. To make changes, edit in VS Code and export again.

**Q: "Can I customize the colors?"**
A: Currently uses default theme. Custom themes are planned for a future release!

**Q: "Does it work offline?"**
A: Yes! Both creating and viewing HTML exports work completely offline.

[RELEASE] Acacia ERD v2.2.0 - Interactive HTML Export

Hey r/vscode! 

I just released a major update to my ERD extension that lets you export your database diagrams as interactive HTML files.

What's cool about it:
- One-click export to standalone HTML
- Recipients can zoom, pan, search, and explore relationships
- No VS Code or special software required to view
- Perfect for documentation, wikis, and sharing with non-tech stakeholders
- Works on mobile too!

This has been the most requested feature and I'm excited to finally ship it. The HTML files are completely self-contained with zero dependencies.
